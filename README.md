# MultiTool
A simple multitool project that was made for my front end software engineering class

Once all dependencies are installed, running the tool is as simple as opening a terminal 
in the directory and using the command "npm start"
To exit one must simply use "ctrl+c" in order to close the tool, the app.js will handle exiting the microservices for you.
